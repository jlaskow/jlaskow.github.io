*I hold a graduate degree in Data Science, backed by hands-on experience in both education and emergency medical services. This unique combination gives me a people-centered lens on technical problem-solving. I'm a certified teacher in Arizona, and I'm currently pursuing licensure in neighboring states. Alongside my data work, I regularly design and share classroom resourcesâ€”worksheets and lesson plans that aim to make learning engaging, flexible, and genuinely fun.*
